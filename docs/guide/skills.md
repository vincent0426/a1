# Skills

**Skills** are reusable, composable units of knowledge that agents can use.

## What are Skills?

Skills encapsulate domain knowledge, patterns, or procedures that agents can apply. They're similar to tools but focus on behavior and patterns rather than specific functions.

## Creating Skills

```python
from a1 import Skill

research_skill = Skill(
    name="research",
    description="Efficient web research methodology",
    content="""
    1. Search broadly first
    2. Narrow down specific sources
    3. Extract key information
    4. Cross-reference findings
    5. Summarize conclusions
    """,
    modules=["requests", "beautifulsoup4"]
)
```

## SkillSets

Group related skills:

```python
from a1 import SkillSet, Skill

research_skills = SkillSet(
    name="research",
    description="All research-related skills",
    skills=[
        web_research_skill,
        academic_research_skill,
        data_analysis_skill,
    ]
)
```

## Using Skills with Agents

```python
from a1 import Agent, Skill, LLM

researcher_skill = Skill(
    name="researcher",
    description="Research methodology",
    content="...",
    modules=[]
)

agent = Agent(
    name="research_agent",
    skills=[researcher_skill],
    tools=[LLM(model="gpt-4o")],
)
```

## Best Practices

### Document Clearly

Good skills have clear, actionable content:

```python
skill = Skill(
    name="summarization",
    description="How to write good summaries",
    content="""
    Key points for effective summaries:
    - Identify main ideas (typically 3-5)
    - Use bullet points
    - Include specific numbers/facts
    - Preserve original meaning
    - Keep to 1/3 original length
    """,
    modules=[]
)
```

### Organize Hierarchically

Use SkillSets to organize complex skill collections:

```python
writing_skills = SkillSet(
    name="writing",
    skills=[
        Skill(name="storytelling", description="..."),
        Skill(name="technical_writing", description="..."),
        Skill(name="summarization", description="..."),
    ]
)
```

### Include Required Modules

Specify Python modules the skill needs:

```python
data_skill = Skill(
    name="data_analysis",
    description="...",
    content="...",
    modules=["pandas", "numpy", "scipy"]
)
```
